## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
av <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/avengers/avengers.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(av)


av1 <- av %>% gather(key = time, value = death, c(11, 13, 15, 17, 19)) %>%
  select(Name.Alias, time, death) %>%
  mutate(time = parse_number(time))

av2 <- av %>% gather(key = time, value = return, c(12, 14, 16, 18, 20)) %>%
  select(Name.Alias, time, return) %>%
  mutate(time = parse_number(time))

av.neat = left_join(av1, av2, by = c("Name.Alias", "time"))

View(av.neat)




im <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/avengers/avengers.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(im)

im = im %>% filter(Name.Alias == 'Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark')
im1 <- im %>% gather(key = time, value = death, c(11, 13, 15, 17, 19)) %>%
  select(Name.Alias, time, death) %>%
  mutate(time = parse_number(time))

im2 <- im %>% gather(key = time, value = return, c(12, 14, 16, 18, 20)) %>%
  select(Name.Alias, time, return) %>%
  mutate(time = parse_number(time))
im.neat = left_join(im1, im2, by = c("Name.Alias", "time"))
view(im.neat)


```

The statement that I chose is the one that states that Iron man faked his death, took a break, then returned. This is reflected in the im dataframe showing that Iron Man had one death (fact checked with his death in Endgame) and one return.
